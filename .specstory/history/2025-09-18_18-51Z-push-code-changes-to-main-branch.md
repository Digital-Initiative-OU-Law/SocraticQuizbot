Let me help you push your changes to the GitHub repository. First, I'll check what we're working with and create a plan.

I see we're having an issue with the git command. Let me initialize the repository first and set it up properly.

```bash
git init
```

```
Reinitialized existing Git repository in C:/Users/seane/OneDrive - University of Oklahoma/Git/Quizbot/.git/                                                     
```
