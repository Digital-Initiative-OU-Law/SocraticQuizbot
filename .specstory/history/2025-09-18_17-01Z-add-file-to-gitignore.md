add this file @update.md to gitignore

I'll add the `update.md` file to the `.gitignore` file for you. Let me first check if a `.gitignore` file exists in the project, and then add the file to it.

Read file: undefined

Now I'll add the `assets/update.md` file to the `.gitignore` file:

Perfect! I've added `assets/update.md` to the `.gitignore` file. The file will now be ignored by Git, so it won't be tracked in version control. This is useful for temporary files like update notes that you don't want to commit to the repository.

_**Assistant**_

I'll add the `assets/codeideas.md` file to the `.gitignore` file as well.

Perfect! I've added `assets/codeideas.md` to the `.gitignore` file as well. Now both `assets/update.md` and `assets/codeideas.md` will be ignored by Git, so they won't be tracked in version control.
